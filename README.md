## How Mest worksÔºü

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/curve.png" width="70%">
</div>

Mest Protocol utilizes an S-shaped bonding curve, blending a quadratic and a square root function for dynamic pricing. When you buy, it mints tokens and drives prices up; when you sell, it burns tokens and lowers prices. Staked ETH is allocated in an interest-rate market to generate sustainable rewards, which are then redistributed to creators.

## Contracts

<div align="center">

</div>

### ERC1155

The token is a standard `ERC1155` contract, with NFTs serving as shares in the bonding curve. When you trade shares, NFTs are minted or burned.

### SharesFactory

SharesFactory is the core contract that contains the bonding curve and yield aggregator logic where you can mint, buy, and sell shares, as well as change yield strategies and claim yields.

### YieldAggregator 

YieldAggregator is a yield strategy contract that provides a common interface for `SharesFactory` to use, such as deposit, withdraw, and claimable. However, the underlying logic can be any yield strategy, such as Aave, Pendle and LRT, or even nothing.
