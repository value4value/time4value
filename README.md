## How Mest works？

### Buy / Sell

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/curve.png" width="70%">
</div>

Mest Protocol is an S-shaped bonding curve that combines a quadratic function and a square root function. Briefly, when you buy, mint tokens and the price gradually rises; when you sell, burn tokens and the price gradually falls. The staked ETH will be deposited into the interest rate market, which provides the creator with a sustainable income, while at the same time you can enjoy the services provided by the creator through NFT.

### Claim

Mest Protocol deposits funds into an interest rate market (e.g. Aave / Pendle.) and the pool will hold equity tokens like aToken / PT. Users can withdraw the corresponding ETH at any time by burn NFTs, while the creator only claims the interest, i.e. the amount that exceeds the pledged assets.

## Contract

</div>

We detail a few of the core contracts in the Mest protocol.

### MestERC1155

MestERC1155 is a standard ERC1155 contract where the NFTs are used as shares for the boding curve, i.e. the ownership share of the pool, and every time a buy / sell shares is made the respective amount of NFTs is minted / burned.

### MestShares

MestShares is the core contract that contains the S-Curve and is responsible to create, mint, and burn shares, as well as to choose the yield strategy and claim the yield through MestYield.

### MestYield 

MestYield is the yield strategy contract. It is a upgradeable proxy contract, which is responsible for the deposit and withdrawal of funds in the interest rate market, and calculates the yield that can be claimed.
